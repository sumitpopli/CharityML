# CharityML
This project show cases different ML techniques that can be used to classify data. 

## Description ##

CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support 
for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that 
every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base,
CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. 
With nearly 15 million working Californians, this project helps build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce 
overhead cost of sending mail. The goal will be to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which 
algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.

## Different steps of this ML project: ##
* Exploring data
* Data Preprocessing
* Applying ML classification algorithms - Random Forest, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine, Ada Boost
* Evaluating model performance results using accuracy scores, f scores , precision score
* Improving results using GridSearch CV, get features importance
* Choosing the final model
